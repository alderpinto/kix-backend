Location of the City and County of San Francisco, California
The combination of cold ocean water and the high heat of the California mainland create
 fall, which are the warmest months of the year. Due to its sharp topography
climate with little seasonal temperature variation
wet winters and dry summers.[31] In addition, since it is surrounded on three sides by water,
San Francisco is located on the west coast of the U.S. at the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula

The goal of invariant sections, ever since the 80s when we first made the GNU
Manifesto an invariant section in the Emacs Manual, was to make
sure they could not be removed. Specifically, to make sure that distributors
 Emacs that also distribute non-free software could not remove the statements of our philosophy,
which they might think of doing because those statements criticize their actions.
The definition of a "transparent" format is complicated, and may be difficult to apply. For example, drawings are required to be in a format that allows
them to be revised straightforwardly with "some widely available drawing editor." The definition
of "widely available" may be difficult to interpret, and may change over time, since, e.g., the open-source
Inkscape editor is rapidly maturing, but has not yet reached version 1.0. This section, which was rewritten somewhat between versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the license, uses the terms
"widely available" and "proprietary" inconsistently and without defining them. According to a strict interpretation of the license, the references to "generic text editors" 
could be interpreted as ruling out any non-human-readable format even if used by an open-source 
word-processor; according to a loose interpretation, however, Microsoft Word .doc format could
qualify as transparent, since a subset of .doc files can be edited perfectly using 
and the format therefore is not one "that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors.
In addition to being an encyclopedic reference, Wikipedia has received major media attention as an online source of breaking
news as it is constantly updated.[14][15] When Time Magazine recognized "You" as their Person of
the Year 2006, praising the accelerating success of on-line collaboration and interaction by millions
of users around the world, Wikipedia was the first particular "Web 2.0" service mentioned.
Repeating thoughts and actions is an essential part of learning. 
Thinking about a specific memory will make it easy to recall. This is the reason why reviews are
such an integral part of education. On first performing a task, it is difficult as there is no path
from axon to dendrite. After several repetitions a pathway begins to form and the
task becomes easier. When the task becomes so easy that you can perform it at any time, the pathway
is fully formed. The speed at which a pathway is formed depends on the individual, but 
is usually localised resulting in talents.[citation needed]
